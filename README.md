# AP4A
UTBM_UV_C++

Attention!

The final version of the project uses "\<thread\>", if you are using an old compiler, chances are the source codes compile :(

I wrote the codes using microsoft visual studio code, and compile them using g++ version 12.2.0 by MSYS2 project. And I think I should add too that I installed Visual Studio 2022 when I can't use std::thread in my codes. Well somehow it worked for me now XD
