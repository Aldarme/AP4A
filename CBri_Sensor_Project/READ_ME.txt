NOTABLE ISSUES
- I have been unable to build this project, apparently because of some problems in the .json files in the .vscode folder.
  I have browsed the internet, looking for answers on how to fix it, but I wasn't able to find much.
  Check them before trying to build this project.
- I haven't yet implemented the possibility to stop the code whenever desire.
  For now, the only way is to force the code shut.

SIDE NOTES
- The CMake should be fine, and the code should be working as intented.
  But again, I haven't been able to try it out.
- Not all the doxygen has been written out. This will come later.
